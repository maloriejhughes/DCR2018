# DCR2018


So.  The gif is too large to upload.  

To recreate this, first run build_the_gif.R, after editing it to include your api creds at the top of the script. WARNING: this takes .5-1hr to run.   The gif script will pull the images from the #rstatsdc tweets and save them under the name dcr.gif in the same directory as the script.   

Then run the DCR_tweets.Rmd.  If you get errors you've never seen that say something about "call", follow the directions in the last r chunk and complain to Hadley.
